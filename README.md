# The Proposales Challenge Project

The idea of this project was born out of using the existing platform with the intended goal of creating a proposal for an imaginary corporate client. 

Since my current work experience has been closely linked to tourism operations, I decided that I would create a proposal for a 5 day team building trip to the Georgian Caucasus mountains as an example.

While doing so, I found myself wanting to take notes about my experience as a first time user of the platform, so here they are.

## First time user experience

### Expectations

Going into the experience I expect to be able to create a proposal and possibly send it to myself for testing. 

I dont know, at this point, how the platform works, but I already have some ideas about it. 

I imagine that it's something like a document editor or a landing page builder, since I know at this point that Proposales is all about moving away from the pdf format and towards a more dynamic and interactive format for proposals.

> Note: Feel free to consider my expectations when reading further about the experience, since they are based on my preconcieved notions of what the platform should be like.

### Landing page

I am brought to the landing page at proposales.com, the first things i notice is the buttons above the fold and the names of the hotels which does create a safe and trustworthy feeling. 

> Note: Reviews right below would add to the feeling of trustworthiness.

Though at first glance none of the buttons above the fold speak to me: "Schedule a demo" feels too slow and complex, "How it works" feels a bit unclear. 

So I look up at the header and see a "Try for free" button which feels better and gives me the feeling that it could help me get started with creating the proposal. 

Just to make sure that I have picked the right path, I look back down and scroll a bit, but what I saw felt like too much calories to expend so I moved on and click on the "Try for free" button.

> Note: I felt like there was little value below the fold, I saw scattered images of what I assumed was the interface elements and promotions. This gave me the feeling that there's a lot of parameters to configure once I start building, but did not give me more clarity or confidence about what I'm getting into. And the section right below it was a lot of tightly packed information, which gave me the feeling that I was scrolling too much and should just go to the "Try for free" button.

### Sign up

I am brought to the signup page.

I look at the form fields and then to the right I see a review, this feels like a nice touch and the clarity of the form is appreciated.

After clicking on the "Create free account" button at first nothing happens, atleast so I thought, so I click again and notice a little floating error message at the top of the page: "This email domain is not allowed". I feel a sense of exclusion, as if I'm not allowed to use the platform. But then I think about it and figure that it has to do with work and personal email addresses. So I try a company email and it works.

> Note: Possibly a "Your work email" field and a error state that is more visible at the form would prevent the feeling of confusion and exclusion.

### Opening the dashboard

Logging into the platform for the first time I see a nice clean dashboard with a big blue button on the top right corner that says "Create Proposal". 

I see that the button has a dropdown menu, being curious I open it and see an import option, but I don't have any files to import, so I click on the "Create Proposal" button. 

I am expecting to be redirected to a proposal creation page, but instead I see a section appear at the top "Create New Template". This slows me down and confuses me a bit, because it makes me think about having to create a template before I can create a proposal. Okay, let's create a template then, I click on the "Create New Template" button.

> Note: A more intuitive experience could be a dialog "Choose where to start" with two options "From scratch" and "From template". Which would not appear if the user has no templates created.
> And looking more into it, I see that when we go to the "Create New Template" we are not actually creating a template, but instead we are creating a proposal which we have the option to save as a template.
