# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation folder! This directory contains browsable, structured documentation for the BaltGoWebsite project. Each major topic or concern will have its own markdown file for clarity and separation.

## Structure
- `api.md`: How to use and extend the API utilities.
- `testing.md`: How to write and run tests.
- `pages.md`: How to create and manage pages in the BaltGoWebsite project.
- `design-system.md`: How to use and extend the design system.

Feel free to add more documentation files as the project grows.
